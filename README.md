**🕵️‍♂️ AICTE Cyber Security Project – Steganography**

Welcome to the AICTE Cyber Security Project repository!
This repo explores the fascinating concept of Steganography — hiding information within images 🖼️, text 📜, and other digital media 💾 as a method of secure communication in Cybersecurity 🔐.



**🌍 What is Steganography?**

Steganography is the practice of concealing a secret message within an ordinary object so that only the intended recipient knows it's there. Unlike traditional encryption 🔑, which scrambles the message, steganography hides its very existence.

✅ Example: A text message hidden inside the pixels of an image 🌈
